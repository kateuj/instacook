# Instacook Testing

![Screen mock-ups of Instacook website](recipes/static/assets/readme-images/screen-mock-up.png)

[View the live project here.](https://instacook-64f0d9d64709.herokuapp.com//)

As with any project, I have been rigorously testing throughout the development process of this web application. I have documented my testing strategy that I planned before I started developing, as well as main bugs that arose whilst developing and how I approached fixing them. I have also tested my web app on different devices and asked family and friends to use and give feedback as to how to improve user experience and inform me of any bugs spotted during use.

With the scale of this project in the grand scheme of things being quite small, automated testing with softwares like Jest or Pytest, for Javascript and Python respectively. In this instance it has not been necessary, but I undestand with larger projects with more extensive functions, that this would be useful and essential. I want to use Jest and Pytest in future larger projects.

I have used a mixture of manual and automated testing while developing, both of which play a key role in forming a web application that works correctly and consistently. Automated testing can be great for doing quick overview results, for example checking code compliant with style guides etc., especially with more extensive projects and applications. Manual testing has allowed me to look at things at a deeper level, checking things like user experience design and in turn finding areas for improvement to strengthen my application as a whole. Using both has allowed me to build reliable functions and code and a higher quality end product.

## HTML Validator - [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/)

I put every page in my site into the HTML validator. This was useful to highlight some code errors that I had missed looking through manually.

### Home Page

The validator highlighted:
* __Error:__ Missed alt tags on images.
* __Error:__"type=text/javascript" - not required.
* __Warning:__ Section lacks h2-h6 heading - The design structure does not require a header for this part. It is the section that holds the flash messages, but from a semantic perspective, it is better to keep the section element rather than a div so I ignored this warning.

#### Before
![Home page validator results before](recipes/static/assets/readme-images/home-page-validator-before.png)
#### After updates
![Home page validator results after](recipes/static/assets/readme-images/home-page-validator-after.png)

### Login Page

The validator highlighted:
* __Warning:__ Section lacks h2-h6 heading - The design structure does not require a header for this part. It is the section that holds the flash messages, but from a semantic perspective, it is better to keep the section element rather than a div so I ignored this warning.

![Login page validator results](recipes/static/assets/readme-images/login-page-validator.png)

### Register Page

The validator highlighted:
* __Warning:__ Section lacks h2-h6 heading - The design structure does not require a header for this part. It is the section that holds the flash messages, but from a semantic perspective, it is better to keep the section element rather than a div so I ignored this warning.

### Contact Page

The validator highlighted:
* __Error:__"type=text" on textarea - not required.
* __Warning:__ Section lacks h2-h6 heading - The design structure does not require a header for this part. It is the section that holds the flash messages, but from a semantic perspective, it is better to keep the section element rather than a div so I ignored this warning.

#### After updates
![Contact page validator results after](recipes/static/assets/readme-images/contact-page-validator-after.png)

### Dashboard Page

The validator would not work for the deployed link of this page, saying it was not retreiveable. This will be due to the fact that dashboard only loads when a session cookie is in place from a user login, so it would not be able to render in the validator. To work around this I added the raw code into the validator, and checked through for any justified errors. The validator, due to the fact the raw code has templating code in it that refers to the base.html for the header etc., was throwing alot of irrelevant errors, as you can see below. I checked each of them one by one, and none were justified errors that required changes.

![script.js validator results](recipes/static/assets/readme-images/scriptjs-validator.png)

### Send_mail.js
* __Warning:__ 'emailjs' undefined variable - this is the code snippet required to interact with the EmailJS API so I cannot change this.

## Lighthouse

To test performance and accessibility, I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools. Accessibility was down by 1% on the search page, based on the contrast between the pink background and white recipe name text on top.

# MANUAL TESTING

## Testing User Stories

### First time user

| Goals | How are they achieved? | Image |
| --- | --- | --- |
| As a first time user, I need to be able to understand the purpose of the site instantly and lead intuitively to thr first call-to-action. | This is achieved through a simple and clear synopsis on screen as the first thing the user sees. Right below to call-to-action to 'Register' is easily visible. | ![Home Page](/recipes/static/assets/readme-images/home-page.png) |
| I want to be able to start creating digital cookbooks quickly and add recipes to them. | Once the new user has registered they are automatically redirected to their dashboard where they can create cookbooks and the create recipes within them. | ![Dashboard Page](/recipes/static/assets/readme-images/dashboard-page.png) |
| I need to have simple instructions and layout so I am not overwhelmed by too much content or instructions. | This is achieved with clear calls to action buttons, like the buttons on each cookbook card on the user's dashboard clearly demonstrate what is possible as next steps. | ![Dashboard Page](/recipes/static/assets/readme-images/dashboard-page.png) |
| I want to be able to get inspiration and a feel for what other recipes users have uploaded. | Whether logged in or not I can filter through and view all the recipes on the site, with 3 simple dropdown filters. A link to this page is in the nav bar on all pages. | ![Search page](/recipes/static/assets/readme-images/search-page.png)|
| Should I have any questions or issues, I need to be able to contact the developer easily | The user can find a link to the contact form on all pages in both the nav bar and footer, so wherever the user is looking on the page, a link will always be clearly visible | ![Contact Page](/recipes/static/assets/readme-images/contact-page.png) |


### Returning/Frequent user
| Goals | How are they achieved? | Image |
| --- | --- | --- |
| As a returning user, I want to easily log in to my existing account to access my content. | The home page displays a prominent login call to action button and once a user is logged in, they are redirected to their dashboard to see their current cookbooks.| ![Home Page](/recipes/static/assets/readme-images/home-page.png) ![Dashboard Page](/recipes/static/assets/readme-images/dashboard-page.png)|
| I want to be able to modify or delete existing cookbooks and recipes | From their dashboard, the user can edit their cookbook names by clicking the edit button on their chosen cookbook card. They can also delete cookbooks and all recipes within that cookbook, just by clicking the delete button on the cookbook card. They will be met with a modal pop-up asking them to confirm their action, to avoid cookbooks and recipes within them being deleted accidentally. From the recipes page view, they can edit and delete recipes using the buttons at the bottom of the recipe info. | ![Dashboard Page](/recipes/static/assets/readme-images/dashboard-page.png) ![Recipes page](/recipes/static/assets/readme-images/edit-delete-recipe-buttons.png) |

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

| No. | Bug | How I solved the issue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Pre-populated dropdown options not working in the Edit Recipe form. | Removed ‘selected’ from options.  |
| 2. | Contact form submit button triggering a new window to open Thank you page rather than just redirect. | Changed from 'window.open' to 'window.location.replace' in function.  |
| 3. | Mobile side nav not working. | Code was missing a closing bracket, so added to fix.  |
| 4. | Cookbook dropdown on add recipe and edit recipe pages showing all cookbooks on database, not just specific user's cookbooks. | I updated the app routes to include user queries and update the render template to call just the user's cookbooks. |
| 5. | Recipe Ingredients and Instructions displaying as one full line without breaks on recipes page and search page. | Searched solutions and found this to add to breaks to the code [Line Breaks Solutions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3206344/passing-html-to-template-using-flask-jinja2) |
| 6. | If dropdowns on Add and edit recipe pages not selected, no validation message appearing | Inspecting the dropdowns in google dev tools I spotted that materialize adds a "display:none" to dropdowns, which removes the usual validation messages. I searched for a solution and found this 'select' code snippet [Dropdown solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34248898/how-to-validate-select-option-for-a-materialize-dropdown ) to remove the materialize CSS on it so that the validation now shows again. Given this issue, I intend on using Materialize alternatives in future to avoid this issue. |
| 7. | Custom 404 page not appearing when incorrect URLs are created | Needed to change the app route to '@app.errorhandler(404)' [Custom 404 app route solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73140435/why-custom-404-page-not-working-with-flask) |
| 8. | White space appearing below nav bar on index page | I found this happened after I changed the search icon from a materialize icon to a font awesome icon. I tested different sizes but the white space remained, so I reverted back to the materialize icons for the menu and nav bar icons used to avoid this issue. |

### Unsolved Bugs
