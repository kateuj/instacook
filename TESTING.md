# Instacook Testing

<img src="#" alt="Screenshot mock-up of Instacook">

[View the live project here.](https://instacook-64f0d9d64709.herokuapp.com//)

As with any project, I have been rigorously testing throughout the development process of this web application. I have documented my testing strategy that I planned before I started developing, as well as main bugs that arose whilst developing and how I approached fixing them. I have also tested my web app on different devices and asked family and friends to use and give feedback as to how to improve user experience and inform me of any bugs spotted during use.

I am also going to attempt to use Pytest to create some automated testing for some of the sites functions to push myself and my testing capabilities, as this is something, along with Jest that I want to use in future projects as I know how useful it can be.

I have used a mixture of manual and automated testing while developing, both of which play a key role in forming a web application that works correctly and consistently. Automated testing can be great for doing quick overview results, for example checking code compliant with style guides etc., especially with more extensive projects and applications. Manual testing has allowed me to look at things at a deeper level, checking things like user experience design and in turn finding areas for improvement to strengthen my application as a whole. Using both has allowed me to build reliable functions and code and a higher quality end product.

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

| No. | Bug | How I solved the issue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | The default labels used by ChartJS for the pie chart and bar chart were being cut on smaller screen sizes. | Removed them and created my own key.  |
| 2. | The pie chart was displaying negative figures and "infinity" percentages. | Set the pie chart to show a message of "No income provided" in place of the percentage if income was 0. The pie chart is also now only visible is there is at least 1 transaction. |
| 3. | Fixed circular import error caught at deploy | When using a linter in VS code the routes import in the __ init __.py was being moved to the top. Moved back tot the bottom manually. |
| 4. | Bug - Auto focus on input element of the add budget modal not working. | I was using the wrong element ID so changed the code to match the correct ID. |
| 5. | When signing up with a capital letter in the user name, user taken to 404 page as the user session was saving the user as example "John" but was then checking the database for user "john" when loading the my budgets page. | Fixed by adding .lower() when storing the user in the session upon registration. |
| 6. | When I changed the background from off-white to white the navbar became transparent. | Set the navbar to white also. |
